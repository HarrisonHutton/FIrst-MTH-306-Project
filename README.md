# First-MTH-306-Project
Used NumPy and SymPy to plot functions, slope fields, solution curves, and to approximate functions using Euler's Method.

The second line of the file holds my answers to my professor's first questions for the project: "What is your favorite food?" and "Who is your favorite musical artist?"

The final block of comments at the end of the file are also my responses to the request of the professor that we include our likes and dislikes about the project.
